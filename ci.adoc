= Jenkins on Jenkins

This document covers the services available on
link:https://ci.jenkins.io[ci.jenkins.io]
and our internal `trusted.ci` instance.


=== Node Labels

We use node labels to define capabilities of the nodes in our Jenkins clusters. These are conventional and are to be used
when referencing nodes, e.g. in the `Jenkinsfile`. 

* `docker` : A Linux (Ubuntu 14.04 LTS) instance with a running Docker daemon
* `windows` : A "stock" Windows 2012 R2 provisioned on Azure
